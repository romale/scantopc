scantopc

***

This litle piece of code is my first programming experience with Go language.
This program provides the "ScanToComputer" functionality given by HP for they multi-functions printers for windows users


Tested with printer model Officejet 6700 on linux, freebsd.
Fails on Qnap arm system.

TODO: 
- Fix Qnap problem
- Manage several MFP on the network.
